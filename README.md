jxpath -- path expressions for json

This is a path-expresion program for experimenting with people's json and xml APIs.

The business interest is in having a lightweight tool for experimenting with APIs, that can generate the code to compile for quality use of constantly-changing amd sometimes fragile APIs.

My personal interests, however, are

using an elegant parser from Rob Pike
doing xpath for the third time (the first two were too big aand too small, respecyively)
using Elliotte Rusty Harold's simplification of element versus attribute
working in Go rather than C++ or Java
The latter are why you should be interested (:-))
