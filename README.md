**jxpath -- path expressions for json**

This is a path-expresion program for experimenting with
people's json and xml APIs.

The business interest is in having a lightweight tool
for experimenting with APIs, that can generate code
to compile parsers as well as interactively interpret
the data. The latter is important when dealing
with constantly-changing and sometimes fragile APIs.

My personal interests, however, are different. They lie in
* using an elegant parser from Rob Pike
* doing xpath for the third time (the first two were too
big and too small, respectively)
* using Elliotte Rusty Harold's simplification of element
versus attribute, and
* working in Go rather than Java or C++

_These_ are why other people should be interested (:-))
